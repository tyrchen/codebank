# Instructions

VAN: based on @0001-initial-idea.md spec and the existing code base (I've already defined the basic data structure, trait etc.), please initialize memory bank.

Please help to improve data structure and fix the bank logic based on requirements.

Please fix the parser, looks like for `fixtures/sample.rs` the functions, structs, traits, impls, etc. hasn't been parsed successfully and they are all empty.

Data structure for various units has improved. Please help to improve parser to parse those information. Update unit tests accordingly.

Module Unit should also parse its own functions, traits, impls, etc. Please help to fix and add relevant unit tests accordingly
