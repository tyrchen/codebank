# Package File

Please also include package file in the generated markdown file. Right after the title.

Please first find the package file int the root directory, if not, go to parent directory, up to 3 levels, until the project file is found. If not found, do not include the package file.

Different languages have different package managers. Please find the appropriate package manager to get the package file:

- Rust: find `Cargo.toml`
- Python: find `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` or `requirements.txt`
- TypeScript: find `package.json`
- C/C++: find `CMakeLists.txt` or `Makefile`

Just copy the entire file content, do not summarize.
